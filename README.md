# TriviaGame

This Trivia game is for a Hw for Unit 5 using javascript and jquery.

There will be a start button to start the game, you will be given a series of question to answers. clicking on an answer will move you on to the next question. Between questions you will get an update if what you choose was correct or incorrect. As you go through each question you will have a 20 second timer. If you fail to make a selection within the time frame it will register as unanswered. At the end of the game you will be updated to how many you got right, wrong, and didn't answer. You will also be given the option to start the game again.

David Juarez is going to be maintaining and contributing to the project.
